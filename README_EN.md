# Pok√©dex Database üá∫üá∏

[Portugu√™s](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

This repository contains the database modeling project for Pok√©dex, a virtual encyclopedia with information about Pok√©mon species. The aim of this project is to provide an efficient database structure to store and manage Pok√©mon information, including their characteristics, categories, species, types, and abilities.

## Database Structure

The Pok√©dex database is modeled using a relational approach. It consists of multiple interrelated tables to store Pok√©mon information. Here is an overview of the main tables in the database:

- `pokemon` table: Stores Pok√©mon data, including name, height, weight, attack values, defense values, and average speed.

- `category` table: Contains the categories of Pok√©mon, such as common, sub-legendary, legendary, or mythical.

- `species` table: Stores the species of Pok√©mon, along with their names and descriptions.

- `type` table: Contains the types of Pok√©mon, such as Fire, Water, Electric, etc.

- `ability` table: Stores the abilities of Pok√©mon, including hidden abilities.

- `rarity` table: Contains information about the rarity of Pok√©mon.

In addition to these main tables, the database also includes join tables to establish relationships between entities, such as `pokemon_has_type` and `pokemon_has_ability`.

## Requirements and Dependencies

- MySQL: You need to have MySQL installed to create and access the Pok√©dex database. You can download MySQL from [https://www.mysql.com/downloads/](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/).

- MySQL Workbench: It is recommended to use MySQL Workbench as a graphical interface to interact with the Pok√©dex database. MySQL Workbench can be downloaded from [https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to the MySQL server.

3. Execute the provided `.sql` file to create the necessary database, tables, and views.

4. With the database created, you can execute SQL queries to insert, update, or retrieve information about Pok√©mon.

## Examples of SQL Queries

The provided `.sql` file in this repository also includes examples of SQL queries that demonstrate the functionality of the Pok√©dex database. These queries cover various scenarios, such as table joins, data filtering, aggregation, and the use of subqueries.
